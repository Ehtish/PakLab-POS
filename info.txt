 Icons for dashboard

   <!-- Here are some icons that could be used for the following code:

            Total Sales: dollar sign icon (e.g. <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>)
            Total Profit: money bill icon (e.g. <i class="fas fa-money-bill"></i>)
            Total Products: shopping bag icon (e.g. <i class="fas fa-shopping-bag"></i>)

Here are some sections that could be included on a point of sale dashboard home page:

Sales summary: Total sales, total profit, and top-selling products.
Financial summary: Revenue trends, profit margins, and expenses overview.
Analytics: Charts and graphs to visualize sales data, customer behavior, and inventory trends.
Alerts and notifications: Low inventory alerts, upcoming events, and important messages.
Quick actions: Buttons or links to common tasks, such as adding a new product or processing a sale.

In this query, the "sales" table has four columns: "id", "product_id", "sale_date",
and "quantity".
The "id" column is defined as an auto-incrementing integer and set as the primary key.
The "product_id" column is defined as an integer and will store the ID of the 
product being sold.
The "sale_date" column is defined as a date field and will store the date of the sale.
Finally, the "quantity" column is defined as an integer and will store the quantity 
of the product sold.
Note that there is also a foreign key constraint on the "product_id" column, which 
references the "id" column of the "products" table. This ensures that only valid 
product IDs can be inserted into the "product_id" column, and that if a product 
is deleted from the "products" table, any associated sales records will also be 
automatically deleted (due to the "ON DELETE CASCADE" option).
